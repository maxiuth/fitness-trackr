# Fitness Trackr

Fitness Trackr is a platform where fitness enthusiasts can share their workouts and
discover new routines. Anyone can browse the site and make an account, and users with an
account will be able to upload and manage their own activities.

This information is accessible via [the Fitness Trackr API](https://fitnesstrac-kr.herokuapp.com/).

A [live demo of the finished project](https://fsa-fitness-trackr.netlify.app/) is available for you to reference.

## Requirements

Write code to meet the following requirements. You can always write
new functions and build new components!

- A _logged-in_ user will see a "delete" button next to each activity in the
  list of activities.
- If the user clicks the delete button for an activity,
  but they are not authorized to delete that activity,
  they will see a corresponding error message.
- If the user clicks the delete button for an activity and
  they _are_ authorized to delete that activity, that activity is deleted.
- After an activity is successfully deleted, the list of activities is
  automatically updated.

> [!WARNING]
>
> Please be mindful of the activities that you create and delete!
> This API is currently **not instanced by cohort** so everyone will be working
> with the _same set of data_, including past and future cohorts.
> The database is occasionally reset, but please reach out to an instructor or staff
> member if you notice an issue with this API.
